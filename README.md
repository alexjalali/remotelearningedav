### This is the EDAV final project for Group18 (Fall 2022)

Authors: Alexandra Jalali, Liang Zhuang, Victoria Xu

Topic: Analyzing Remote Learning Preferences for different districts in New York City

Description: In this project, we analyzed students' learning preferences (hybrid, remote) and compare the result with other variables such as race/ethnicity, grade level, poverty, gender, and other variables. We also compare test scores and learning preferences to see how different preferences lead to different student outcomes.
