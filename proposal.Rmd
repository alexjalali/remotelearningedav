# Proposal

## Research topic

Our topic will be analyzing remote learning preferences for different public school districts in New York City. We will analyze race/ethnicity, grade level, poverty, gender, disability, and more variables per district and compare those to the percentage of students who prefer to work remote rather than hybrid. Doing this we hope to see patterns and relationships between remote learning preferences and other variables, and be able to draw conclusions. We will also analyze ELA (English Language Arts) test scores and math test scores for public school students by district, and take variables such as ethnicity, gender, and poverty into account, to potentially find a correlation between student preferences and test result outcomes.

Remote learning is a fairly new concept popularized by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students of Columbia University who attended part of our undergraduate education remote, we are interested in remote learning preferences for K-12 students, what factors impact it, and how remote learning changes student outcomes. Our conclusions could assist educational institutions in making decisions for online learning. It is important to make sure there is fairness for all students of all economic backgrounds in receiving an education.
