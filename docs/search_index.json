We will analyze race/ethnicity, grade level, poverty, gender, disability, and more variables per district and compare those to the percentage of students who prefer to work remote rather than hybrid. Doing this we hope to see patterns and relationships between remote learning preferences and other variables, and be able to draw conclusions. We will also analyze ELA (English Language Arts) test scores and math test scores for public school students by district, and take variables such as ethnicity, gender, and poverty into account, to potentially find a correlation between student preferences and test result outcomes. Remote learning is a fairly new concept popularized by the COVID-19 pandemic. As students of Columbia University who attended part of our undergraduate education remote, we are interested in remote learning preferences for K-12 students, what factors impact it, and how remote learning changes student outcomes. Our conclusions could assist educational institutions in making decisions for online learning. It is important to make sure there is fairness for all students of all economic backgrounds in receiving an education. 2.2 Data availability "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
